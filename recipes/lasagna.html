        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, 
        savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead 
        recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.</p>

                    <li>3/4 lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>

                    <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Lasagna</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
                    <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <h4>Prep Work</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set 
                        aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Make the Meat Sauce</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them 
                        soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar 
                        which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. 
                        Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and 
                        crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic 
                        during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the 
                        bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, 
                        hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce 
                        to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
                    <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna 
                        noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente 
                        according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t 
                        overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to 
                        prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water 
                        until noodles are completely cool.</li>
                    <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin 
                        assembling the lasagna.</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Assemble</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch 
                        casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
                    <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by 
                        about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</li>
                    <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 1/2 
                        cups meat sauce.</li>
                    <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the 
                        rest of the meat sauce.</li>
                    <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
                    <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of 
                        the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Bake</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to 
                        serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>
                </ol>
